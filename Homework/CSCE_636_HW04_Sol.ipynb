        "**For the MNIST Dataset (for handwritten digit recognition), in the past, we built a one-input-one-output model, where the input is an image, and the output is a length-10 vector that represents a probability vector for the 10 classes (from class 0 to class 9). Today, let's build a one-input-multiple-output model, which has 10 outputs y_0, y_1, y_2, ..., y_9, where each y_i (for i between 0 and 9) is a real number between 0 and 1 that represents the probability for the input image to belong to class i. (That is, the probability that the input image does not belong to class i is 1 - y_i.) In other words, this new model is a combination of 10 binary classifiers (that is, one binary classifier for each class). The loss function for each y_i is the binary cross-entropy function, and the overall loss for the model is the summation of the 10 binary cross-entropies.**\n",

Then, we let i\\* be the label that our model predicts for the input image. Then, \"aggregateAccuracy\" is simply the \"accuracy\" that we usually talk about: it is the fraction of images whose predicted label equals the true label.**\n",
